# Closest-Pair-Problem
#### Using Divide and Conquer Algorithm
Closest Pair Problem is to find the minimum distance between two points among n number of points. In order to find the distance between two points we used the distance formula. There are two ways to solve this problem:
+ BruteForce Algorithm
+ Divide and Conquer Algorithm
